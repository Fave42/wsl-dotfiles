# wsl-dotfiles
My dotfiles for running an i3-based environment within WSL, working as of Windows Fall Creators Update (version 1709).

I wrote a bit about this setup [here](https://tbrindus.ca/ricing-wsl/).

Included are configuration files and scripts for:

* i3-gaps
* rofi
* terminator
* polybar
* time-of-day dependent wallpaper switcher
* [script to launch VcXsrv and i3 from Windows](https://github.com/Xyene/wsl-dotfiles/blob/master/wsl.vbs)
